# AsyncInn
Welcome to the Async Inn! This is a work in progress of a front and back end hotel managment system, using ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework. It allows a hotel admin to access the hotel's database to view and change data regarding hotels, rooms, room layouts, room amenities, and types of amenities.

## Changes
- 1/29/2019 - Dependency Injection implemented as a middleware repository between the database and the web app for Hotels, Rooms, and Amenities.

## Directions
Users will be redirected to the hotel database home page. From there, a navigation bar directs you to the different database tables that you can view and edit.
